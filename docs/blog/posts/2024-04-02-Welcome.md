ðŸŽ‰ **Welcome to our new site for Cobra Tools!** ðŸŽ‰

As well as providing easier navigation and steps for downloading, installing, and updating the tools, this new site will continue to be expanded with FAQs, modding guides, troubleshooting guides, and more. Some of these are present already, but still under construction. You can check them out in the navigation above. 

We have also created a [:fontawesome-brands-trello: Trello](https://trello.com/w/cobratools){:target=_blank} with several boards for better user-facing progress tracking on tool and modding developments. Please check it out!
