**üì¢ Server Announcement: Important Updates and Changes Ahead! üì¢**

Hello, Open Naja Modding Community!

We hope you're all doing well and creating amazing mods. We're reaching out today with some important updates and changes to our server that we believe will help foster a more supportive and productive environment for all our members.

## Team Changes

First, we want to extend our gratitude to our moderation team for their contributions. As our modding community continues to thrive, we're taking this opportunity to refresh our team structure to ensure we're providing the best possible support for everyone. Due to time constraints from his many other committments, Leaf will no longer be acting as Community Manager or Moderator. In keeping with our focus on optimizing the team for community growth, you may also notice some other changes in team member roles.

## Open Call for Moderators

With these changes, we're on the lookout for passionate, dedicated individuals to join our moderation team. If you have a love for modding, a desire to help others, and a commitment to maintaining a positive community, we'd love to hear from you. Please reach out to me with express intent to apply.

## Website Updates

**New Landing Page!** We have been working hard on our new [github.io page](https://opennaja.github.io/cobra-tools/). As well as providing easier navigation and steps for downloading, installing, and updating the tools, this new site will continue to be expanded with FAQs, modding guides, troubleshooting guides, and more.

**New Trello!** To better publicize Cobra Tools and ACSE development, as well as new kinds of tools and mods being prototyped by the developers, we have [created a Trello](https://trello.com/w/cobratools) to put all of this in one easy to view place. 

- [:fontawesome-brands-trello: Cobra Tools](https://trello.com/b/QU0AjbcR/cobra-tools): This board tracks some of the things coming to Cobra Tools, as GitHub Issues and Projects lack user-friendly views.
- [:fontawesome-brands-trello: PZ Meta Wishlist](https://trello.com/b/wBiAoILg/pz-meta-wishlist): This board tracks Free Update Meta-Wishlist items being considered and worked on by the devs.
- [:fontawesome-brands-trello: ACSE Corp Research Lab](https://trello.com/b/uFYj0FMV/acse-corp-research-lab): This board tracks the progress of new ACSE features, and major new additions, mechanics, and overhauls for Frontier games.
- [:fontawesome-brands-trello: PZPlus Expansions](https://trello.com/b/C55ORE3m/pzplus-expansions): This board tracks the progress of various sub-mods for PZPlus, with a focus on remastering and expanding neglected parts of the game.

## Channel Updates

Following positive feedback from the JWE modding channel, we are reverting the PZ modding channel back to being accessible for modders only. This change aims to create a more focused environment for mod discussion and development. Those with Certified Modder role will retain access. Aspiring modders without the role yet can still receive modding help in **[:discord-topic: modding-help-pz](https://discord.com/channels/680909673607463131/1020301021756543017)** and **[:discord-topic: modding-help-jwe2](https://discord.com/channels/680909673607463131/1020306232281677916)**.

## New Post Guidelines

To ensure our new members find the help and resources they need efficiently, we've improved our Post Guidelines in **[:discord-topic: modding-help-pz](https://discord.com/channels/680909673607463131/1020301021756543017)** and **[:discord-topic: modding-help-jwe2](https://discord.com/channels/680909673607463131/1020306232281677916)**. These guidelines will better direct questions and discussions to the appropriate channels, making it easier for everyone to get the support they need.

## New Modding Guidelines

We believe in upholding a creative modding environment where everyone feels empowered to mod whatever inspires them, regardless of existing mod releases. Collaborating to improve existing mods is welcome, but pressuring others to do so or discouraging others' efforts to release their own version is strictly prohibited.

## New Commissioning Guidelines

We have instituted new rules for commissions clarifying and expanding the requirements for using a third party's work, as well as making explicit that mod updates must follow the same monetization rules as mod releases. Please refer to **[:discord-rules: rules](https://discord.com/channels/680909673607463131/680910494151868532)**, Rule 9.

These new rules align well with the existing rules against paywalled, time-gated, and exclusive/private-use commissions. This is done in an effort to foster improved community health and to prevent others' work from being used without permission to make a profit.

## New Commission Request Boards

We are implementing commission request channels for each game, providing more visibility to modders on what commissions are available to take on. 

- **Get Your Mod Commission Seen!** Post your request in the game's commission board clearly outlining the commission details to attract the right modder for the job.
- **Team Up for Bigger Projects.** Team up with up to four others to pool resources and collectively request the mod. Five members is a suggested maximum to minimize micromanagement and decrease the likeilhood of dropouts. Highly motivated individuals and willing modders may exceed this at their discretion.
- **Find Your Modding Match!** Modders may DM you or respond to the post to express interest in taking the commission on. You are then encouraged to reach out to interested modders to come to an agreement. Once a modder has been selected, simply make an update stating who you chose and close the topic.
- **Private Negotiation Avoids Public Bidding Wars.** Please take note that members and modders alike need not publicize the negotiations over pricing and contracts. Such things are ultimately a private negotiation between both parties.

## Developer Support

There have been new rules instituted regarding developer support. Please refer to **[:discord-rules: rules](https://discord.com/channels/680909673607463131/680910494151868532)**, Rule 11.

## Revamped Rules

Our **[:discord-rules: rules](https://discord.com/channels/680909673607463131/680910494151868532)** have been revamped to improve legibility, and updated to include stray rules from other locations such as **[:discord-announcements: announcements](https://discord.com/channels/680909673607463131/680910508756303894)**. In addition to these improvements, there have also been other minor updates. We recommend everyone revisit the rules in full to ensure they are familiar with the latest updates.

## Conclusion

We believe these changes will help our community grow stronger, more cohesive, and more creative. Your feedback is invaluable to us, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts and suggestions with me or other staff.

Thank you all for your continued support and dedication to modding. Let's keep creating, sharing, and inspiring each other.

Happy Modding!
