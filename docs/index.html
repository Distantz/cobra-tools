## Installation

**Read the instructions steps carefully and do not jump ahead and start downloading everything or you will miss important steps**.

Get the latest source code [here](https://github.com/OpenNaja/cobra-tools/archive/master.zip) and unzip to a folder of your choice. 

### Installing Prerequisites

You need to have installed:
- [Python 3.11 64-bit](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (**make sure you select the option "Add Python to PATH" during installation;** 32-bit versions of Python are not recommended.)
- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2017 x64](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) (needed for texture conversion)
- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2013 x86](https://aka.ms/highdpimfc2013x86enu) (needed for lua decompile)


### Installing Python dependencies

Opening any of the GUI tools after installing Python 3.11 and the redistributables will auto-install the Python dependencies for you. You may also be prompted to update outdated packages.

Simply follow the instructions, typing `y` and hitting `Enter`.

---

If you would like to install the dependencies manually:

1. Open the Cobra Tools folder in Windows File Explorer.
2. In the File Explorer address bar, type `cmd` and hit `Enter`. This will open a command prompt in your Cobra Tools folder.
3. In the command prompt type the following line and hit `Enter`

    ```
    pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    <sup>**Please note:** If you do not open cmd in your Cobra Tools folder, you will need to provide the full path to `requirements.txt`</sup>  
    <sup>**Note:** You may need to upgrade pip using `python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip` instead.</sup>

### Blender Plugin Installation

Currently the tools work in blender 3.6 to 4.0.

    ```
    pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```
    <sup>**Note:** You may need to upgrade pip using `python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip` instead.</sup>
2. Then install the pre-commit hooks:
    
    ```

    ```

## Disclaimers
- Remember to backup all mod files and stock files. Any patches will reset or break the mods and will need to be redone and re-released. 
- Not all model files are supported at this time. Some may crash on import or export. Even if they (seemingly) import and export fine, the result is not guaranteed to work ingame.
