By downloading and using this software, you agree to the following conditions:

- [x] **Use this software at your own risk.** It may cause damage to you, your equipment or your data. The authors are not responsible for your actions.
- [ ] **Do NOT use this software to circumvent copy protections.** Especially, do not try to unlock downloadable content for free, share official artwork or intellectual property or engage in so-called data mining to announce game content before an official announcement.
- [ ] **Do NOT affect online modes of the game drastically using this software.** Do not try to gain any advantage over other players. Online gameplay and modifications should be restricted as much as possible and not encouraged.
- [x] **Secure permission to use other parties' work in your mods.** This includes but is not limited to using IP, artwork, concepts, designs, and 3D models (e.g. porting models from another game, **including other Frontier games**). If you don't have the approval of the copyright holder(s), be prepared to face the consequences.
- [x] **Adhere strictly to the license of incorporated third-party works** This includes correct attribution, linking, and disclaiming as per the license requirements wherever work made with this software is displayed or uploaded.
- [ ] **Do NOT seek monetary compensation for mods made with this software.** Mods created with the tools must be freely available. This means no charging money, asking for donations, or offering exclusivity (even if temporary) for access to mods. Mod updates should also be free.
- [ ] **Do NOT monetize ported work.** Without explicit permission, one should not monetize someone else's work. This means that using the tool to republish others' works should not be done for profit, but for the modding community. Mods with ported assets must opt out of any direct revenue. Unsolicited donations for the work done are still fine, as long as they are not tied to any specific ported mod.

If you still have doubts, consider checking [Frontier's official Mod Policy](https://workshop.frontierstore.net/mod-policy){:target="_blank"}.
