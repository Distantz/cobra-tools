# Updating

## GUI Tools

To update the tools themselves, you should delete the contents of your `cobra-tools`(1) folder entirely and extract the updated tools ZIP into the same folder. This clears out any old, unused, or cached files that may interfere with tool updates.
{ .annotate }

1. e.g. `cobra-tools-master`

## Python Dependencies

The tools have an auto updater to handle Python dependency updates for you, which will operate the same as the automatic installer in [Installing Python Dependencies](Download.md#installing-python-dependencies).

## Symlinking Guide

If you would prefer to ensure that your GUI tools and Blender Plugin are always synced, you can create a symlink so that both operate from the same location.
